 https://colab.research.google.com/github/TukangM/php-build-scripts-auto/blob/stable/php-auto-build-scripts-Linux_arm64.ipynb this scripts made by me @TukangM. this script will make you php8-arm64 for linux (android too-termux-KalilinuxNethunterMobile). compining it takes 30mins-1hours (if you get 2 more processor cores. maybe the process will be fast if you are lucky). if you not waiting LONG-TIME for compiling php8-arm64, use the releases https://github.com/TukangM/php-build-scripts-auto/releases/
